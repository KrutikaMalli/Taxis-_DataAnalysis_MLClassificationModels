# Taxis_DataAnalysis_MLClassificationModels
This Dataset involves: 
- Data cleaning i.e handling of missing value and duplicates
- Exploratory Data Analysis, creation of donut chart & bar chart
- Outlier detection using Box plot, application of TF-IDF and SVD on text columns
- Power & Quantile transformations to normalize numerical features
- Comparision of 3 classifiers i.e
  (a) LightGBM
  (b) CatBoost
  (c) Random Forest
  - Each model is trained with a specific set of hyperparameters and evaluated using cross-validation with the ROC AUC metric.
